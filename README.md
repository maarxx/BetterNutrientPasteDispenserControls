# Introduction and Explanation

You'll add the mod. You'll enable the mod.

When you select a Nutrient Paste Dispenser, you'll see widget buttons to "Dispense 1", "Dispense 5", and "Dispense 25".

This offers a more convenient alternative to the weird vanilla thing where you restrict a pawn at the spot and spam the draft button.
