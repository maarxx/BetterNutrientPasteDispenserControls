# Introduction

The mod adds buttons to manually dispense from a Nutrient Paste Dispenser.

When you select a Nutrient Paste Dispenser, you'll see widget buttons to "Dispense 1", "Dispense 5", and "Dispense 25".

This offers a more convenient alternative to the weird vanilla thing where you restrict a pawn at the spot and spam the draft button.
